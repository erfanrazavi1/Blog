# Blog
 Project Description  This project is a Django-based web application consisting of three main apps:  Accounts – A custom authentication system using JWT for user registration, login, logout, and profile management. Blog – A blogging platform where users can create, edit, and categorize posts. Filtering by category is also supported. Comment – A commenting system that allows users to leave comments on blog posts. The project utilizes Django Rest Framework (DRF) for building APIs and implements JWT authentication for secure user management. It follows best practices for modularity, security, and scalability.
